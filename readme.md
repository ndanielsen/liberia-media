# Liberia: Analysis of Media Coverage by Development Indicators During Times of Ebola
_Disclaimer: I have only surface level knowledge of the history of Liberia and its people. It was for this reason that I chose this project. I believe that I am mostly unbiased by previous knowledge or beliefs and can place an emphasis on the data analysis. Obviously I am an outsider and have never visited Liberia. I am familiar with Guinea, Cote D'Ivoire, Senegal, Mali and other areas of West Africa._

###Research Question 
_Does the level of development and demography of a location in Liberia (county, municipality and lower levels like village) affected the quantity and quality of media coverage (local, national and international)?_

###Hypothesis
I hypothesize that timely and accurate media coverage of significant events in Liberia is determined by population density but also by the availability (and funcationality) of telecommunications infrastructure and localized political centers of gravity and governance. Furthermore I hypothesize that there is a signficiant politicization of media by political parties which is likely fueled by ethnic and linguistic divisions. 


###Strategy 
Since the quantiy of Ebola media coverage has been extensive, I hope to test my hypothesis by contrasting Ebola media coverage content with geographical, demographic, other development indicators.

#Data

### Liberia Demographic and Development Data
I'm collecting as much data as I can on Liberia at the county, municipal, and village level if possible. I think that it will be extremely hard to find much data below the county level. 

[USAID Open Data on Liberia](http://results.usaid.gov/liberia#fy2013)

[NetHope's Open Humanitarian Data Respository on Liberia](http://ohdr.nethope.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets?q=Liberia)

[Liberia 2008 Census Data](http://www.lisgis.net/page_info.php?7d5f44532cbfc489b8db9e12e44eb820=MzQy) 

[Demographic and Health Survey 2013](http://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset/Liberia_Standard-DHS_2013.cfm)<br>
_The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program has collected, analyzed, and disseminated accurate and representative data on population, health, HIV, and nutrition through more than 300 surveys in over 90 countries._


### Liberia Media Content 

I am targetting Liberia located Media Outlets that have a signficant internet publications. Most of the sites in the links below that I have looked appear to be easily to scrape. 

[Online News Paper Links](http://www.abyznewslinks.com/liber.htm)

[Wikipedia Media Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Newspapers_published_in_Liberia)

I have already collected about 15,000 media stories in a raw format but I could collect more.


### Liberia Ebola Data

[Github of Caitlin Rivers](https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola/tree/master/liberia_data)
_Pretty solid collection and analysis of Ebola related data by the county level._

[Sub-national time series data on Ebola cases and deaths in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali since March 2014](https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/dataset/rowca-ebola-cases)
_Compiled data of Ebola cases and deaths that is regularly updated_


#Project Plans (Still Under Development)

###What is my Acceptance criteria?

Model with 80% accuracy?


###What are actionable outcomes from the anaylsis?

Identify publications or authors that have less bias, that write more about specific areas or categories of areas.

Identify rural/ urban biases.

###Success factors

*What do I consider a successful project to consist of?*

####Open Source Tools for Reproducing and Improving My Work in Other Countries and Contexts

All raw data cleaned into easily machine readable formats and shared for analysis by others.

Python collection and analysis tools written in a manner to be easily used again for another country such as Sierra Leon.

####Visualizations

Create map of media coverage in general for a specific period of time.

Create map of Ebola casualties by different time internals.

Create an overlapping map of Ebolas casualties versus media coverage. (Heat map?)

####Model

Create a model of news coverageby county level and determine correlation with DHS data and other indicators.
