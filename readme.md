# Liberia Geospatial and Media Sector Data Collection
_Disclaimer: I have only surface level knowledge of the history of Liberia and it's people. It was for this reason that I chose this project. I believe that I am mostly unbiased by previous knowledge or beliefs and can place an emphasis on the data analysis._


###Research Question 
_Does the level of development and demography of a location in Liberia (county, municipality and lower levels like village) affected the quantity and quality of media coverage (local, national and international)?_

###Hypothesis
I hypothesize that timely and accurate media coverage of significant events in Liberia is determined by population density but also by the availability (and funcationality) of telecommunications infrastructure and localized political centers of gravity and governance. Furthermore I hypothesize that there is a signficiant politicization of media by political parties which is likely fueled by ethnic and linguistic divisions. 


###Strategy 
Since the quantiy of Ebola media coverage has been extensive, I hope to test my hypothesis by contrasting Ebola media coverage content with geospatial and other development indicators.

## Geospatial Data
I'm collecting as much data as I can on Liberia at the county, municipal, and village level if possible.
